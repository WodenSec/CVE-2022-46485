# ngDoS - ngSurvey 2.4.25 Denial of Service

ngSurvey version 2.4.25 is vulnerable to Denial of Service if a survey contains a  "Text Field" or "Comment Field".
The issue exists because Text and Comment fields do not include a character limit. An attacker can submit an infinite number of characters in the fields.
During the testing, the docker application crashed while submitting the request.
The survey's answer was still submitted. When the ngSurvey admin tries to view respondent's data, activity logs or export the results the web browser uses excessive amount of RAM or the server returns an internal error (500). Making the survey's data inaccessible.

>Note 
> Older versions are also probably vulnerable.
> The "slider" question may also be vulnerable with a large integer instead of a string. It could not be confirmed on my local environment.

## Exploitation steps

- Open the survey page and find a text or comment field.
- Fill the survey normally. In the text or comment field, type `dospayload` (anything else will work but I'll be using this string).
- Click "Submit" but intercept the request with Burp Suite.
- Right-click the request > Extensions > Copy As Python-Requests > Copy as requests. (You need the Copy As Python-Requests extension, install it from the BApp Store)
- Paste the code in a new file.
- Under `import requests`, add the following code `dospayload= "A" * 123456789`
- Find the text/comment answer in the `burp0_json`. It will look like this `"value" : "dospayload"`.
- Remove the double quotes to make it look like this `"value" : dospayload`.
- If you want to check the response, store the request in a variable and print the status_code and content.

The final code should look like this:
